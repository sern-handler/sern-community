That's short for `Read Eval Print Loop`.\nWhich means to read some code, dump it in an `eval()` statement, print the result, and loop.\n\n**_A discord bot is not that._**\nA Discord bot sets up a permanent websocket connection to the discord server and connects to the rest gateway.\nThere is read yes, but **no eval**, **no print**, and **no loop**.\n\n**So what should you use instead?**\nThe most ideal way is to just use the `watch` flag of `tsc` (`tsc --watch`) and run `node dist/index.js` to run your bot, then cancel that process and restart it when you have changes that require restarting.\nYou would open 2 terminal tabs, 1 in which you run `tsc --watch` and another in which you run the bot.\nThis is in particular the most ideal way, because Discord has a limit to the amount of times you can login with your bot, or register commands, per day.\nConstantly logging in over and over again due to an auto-restarting process will get you close to that limit very quickly and once you exceed it, your development will be halted entirely for the current day.\n\nHowever, this can be quite tedious so a great package to use instead is [`tsc-watch`](<https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsc-watch>).",
